# Temporarily Removed Features

This document lists features we've temporarily removed to simplify the prototype and focus on the core interface patterns functionality.

## User Preferences Screen
- Initial onboarding experience where users select preferences
- AI-generated custom labels based on user input
- Preference-based interface customization

## Creator System
- Creator profiles with curated interface styles
- Creator subscription functionality
- Creator-based interface selection
- Aesthetic toggles for each creator

These features can be reintegrated once we've established a solid foundation for the interface patterns library and composition system.

## Reintegration Strategy
When reintroducing these features, we should:

1. Make creators "owners" of patterns/artifacts rather than complete interfaces
2. Allow users to mix and match patterns from different creators
3. Use the preference system to suggest initial patterns but not restrict choices
4. Keep the interface for browsing patterns separate from the preferences system
